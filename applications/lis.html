            <h3>Description</h3>
            LIS is a german shortcut for "Lernen im Schlaf" (En. "Lerning during the sleep"). It is a bigger project than the 
            other ones. It contains of the native Android application and a wearable device. The idea is to measure bio-signals 
            like the heartrate, oxygen saturation and movements during the sleep, track them with the app and process them to identify 
            the different sleep stages. During specific sleep stages, the app plays vocabulary that was learned previously that day. 
            The idea came to us while reading a study that showed, that this has a positive effect on the results.</br></br>
            The app itself receives the values via bluetooth, writes them into files to persist the data, and processes them to detect 
            the sleep stage. During specific sleep stages, the chosen vocabulary gets played. The app does not have to be active during 
            this process.</br></br>
            <h3>Motivation</h3>
            LIS was the diploma project in school, on which I have worked with two friends. We have worked on this for about 7 months and 
            finished it with a more than 100 pages documentation. We seperated the project in several parts, whereby my major part was to 
            develop the application. This was how I got into app development, and how I found the passion for it. This was the biggest project 
            I have ever worked on, and all of us loved the process.</br></br>
            <h3>What I learned</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>The very basics of the Andorid SDK</li>
              <li>The programming language Kotlin</li>
              <li>Very deep understanding of Java</li>
              <li>How to implement SQLite databases</li>
              <li>How to use Services and BroadcastReceivers</li>
              <li>How to use the TextToSpeech class</li>
              <li>How to implement Bluetooth</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Besides from coding</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>How to work in a team (And that it can be difficult sometimes)</li>
              <li>How to manage a project</li>
              <li>How to document a project</li>
              <li>Most important: I found out about one of my passions</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Sidenote</h3>
            Note, that this was the first application I have ever developed, and continued with my other applications afterwards. 
            Therefore, it contains a lot of bad practice implementations. Right after we finished the project, I developed a second 
            version of the app, where I improved a lot of those bad practices (Therefore LIS V2.0). But this was still the beginning of my journey, and in 
            the meanwhile, I have learned a lot of new stuff which I didn't implement into the app, because we didn't continue with the 
            project after school had finished. Therefore, there are still a lot of bad practice implementations.</br>
            Also note that the detection of the sleep stages didn't work 100%, because this was beyond our knowledge at the moment.
